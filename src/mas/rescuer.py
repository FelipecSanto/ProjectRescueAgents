##  RESCUER AGENT
### @Author: Tacla (UTFPR)
### Demo of use of VictimSim
### This rescuer version implements:
### - clustering of victims by quadrants of the explored region 
### - definition of a sequence of rescue of victims of a cluster
### - assigning one cluster to one rescuer
### - calculating paths between pair of victims using breadth-first search
###
### One of the rescuers is the master in charge of unifying the maps and the information
### about the found victims.
